// Maps are a bit confusing in the way they work / pointers...
// Maps can be modified without passing as an address to it (e.g. `&myMap`),
// this *feels* like a "reference type" but they are not.
// A map value is a pointer to a `runtime.hmap` structure -
// so when you pass a map to a function/method, you are indieed copying it,
// but just the pointer part, not the underlying data structure that contains the data.
// A gotcha with maps is that they can be a `nil` value.
// A `nil` map behaves like an empty map when reading, but attempts to write to a `nil` map
// will cause a runtime panic. Therefor never initialise a nil map variable (`var m map[string]string`)
// instead, initialise an empty map (`var m map[string]string{}`)
// or use the `make` keyword to create one: (`var m = make(map[string]string)`)
// bot create an empty `hash map` and point the variable to it, which means you will never get a runtime panic.
